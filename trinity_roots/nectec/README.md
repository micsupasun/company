# nectec project

## Objective
The objective of this project seems to be the identification of frequent itemsets and the generation of association rules using the Apriori algorithm. This is a common task in market basket analysis, where the goal is to find patterns in purchase data, such as items that are often bought together.

## Step
1. Import Libraries.
2. Load Data.
3. Data Preprocessing.
4. Apply Apriori Algorithm.
5. Generate Association Rules.

## Result
1. Frequent Itemsets: The output includes a list of itemsets that frequently occur together in the transactions.
2. Association Rules: The generated rules indicate the likelihood of purchasing certain items together. For example, if a customer buys bread, they may also buy butter with a certain confidence level.

## Documentation
[masket_basket.ipynb](https://github.com/micsupasun/company/blob/main/trinity_roots/nectec/masket_basket.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook that contains the code for performing market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm. The file imports the necessary libraries, loads and preprocesses the data, applies the Apriori algorithm, and generates association rules.
