# coffee-class-cafe project
## Objective
The objective of the coffee-class-cafe project is to develop a recommendation system for a cafe, utilizing deep learning techniques to predict user preferences based on historical data. The goal is to improve user satisfaction by accurately predicting menu items or categories that users are likely to enjoy

## Step
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
2. Model Development:
3. Model Training:
4. Evaluation and Visualization:

## Result
1. Training and Validation Loss: Visualizations of the loss over epochs for both the training and validation datasets.
2. Model Performance Metrics: Include key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), precision, recall, and accuracy, if applicable.
Recommendations: Insights derived from the model, such as the most recommended categories for specific user segments.
