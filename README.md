1. [coffee-class-cafe](https://github.com/micsupasun/company/tree/main/trinity_roots/coffee-class-cafe) project is to develop a recommendation system for a cafe, utilizing deep learning techniques to predict user preferences based on historical data. The goal is to improve user satisfaction by accurately predicting menu items or categories that users are likely to enjoy

2. [nectec](https://github.com/micsupasun/company/tree/main/trinity_roots/nectec) project seems to be the identification of frequent itemsets and the generation of association rules using the Apriori algorithm. This is a common task in market basket analysis, where the goal is to find patterns in purchase data, such as items that are often bought together.
